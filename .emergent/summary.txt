The AI engineer's work primarily focused on implementing and debugging the FantaPay app's authentication and navigation systems. The initial phase involved setting up the core project, integrating Google OAuth and biometric authentication, and establishing a basic UI. A significant portion of the trajectory details the iterative process of fixing backend serialization issues (Pydantic v2, ObjectId handling) and, more critically, resolving persistent frontend navigation conflicts arising from mixing  and  paradigms. Despite numerous attempts to unify the navigation and ensure proper context propagation, the AI engineer consistently encountered routing errors (Unmatched Route, useAuth must be used within an AuthProvider) and API connectivity problems from the frontend, even while confirming the backend's stability. The user repeatedly emphasized the blocking nature of these issues, demanding a fully functional, end-to-end testable app.

<product_requirements>
FantaPay is a mobile fintech app for managing fantasy league competitions, registrations, wallets, simulated payments, logs, and prize distribution. The MVP requires:
- **User Authentication**: Email/password, Google OAuth (initially), Apple ID, Facebook, biometric login (Face ID/fingerprint). Enhanced to include OTP verification for email/password signup, with  status and secure database storage (username, email, password hash, createdAt, lastLogin, authMethod, temporary OTPs).
- **Home/Dashboard**: 4 sections (Create/Join Competition, Wallet, Logs/Notifications) with animated fintech cards.
- **Competition Management**: Wizard for creation (name, rules: daily/final/mixed prizes with unlimited slots), invite links/codes. Joining via code/link. Manual standings entry by admin.
- **Wallet System**:  (personal balance, simulated top-up/withdraw).  (total balance, payment table, admin controls).
- **Prize Distribution**: Automatic transfers from competition wallet to  based on admin-selected winners or league closure rules. All transactions logged.
- **Language Support**: Multilingual (Italian, English), user-selectable at launch and later.
- **Logs & Transparency**: Public league feed, audit log for compliance.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Full end-to-end functionality for registration, login, competition creation/joining, simulated wallet operations, admin standing updates, prize distribution, and multi-language support.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frontend**: React Native, Expo Router, TypeScript, React Navigation, i18next (multi-language), Zustand/TanStack Query (state), Expo LocalAuthentication (biometrics), SecureStore (secure storage).
- **Backend**: FastAPI, MongoDB, Pydantic v2 (data models), bcrypt (password hashing).
- **Authentication**: Google OAuth (Emergent integration), Email/Password with OTP verification.
- **Architecture**: Full-stack with mobile frontend, Python backend, NoSQL database.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a full-stack architecture with an Expo (React Native) frontend, a FastAPI backend, and a MongoDB database.

**Directory Structure:**


-   ****: The main FastAPI backend application.
    -   **Importance**: Handles all API endpoints for authentication, user management, competitions, wallets, and transactions. Connects to MongoDB.
    -   **Changes Made**: Initial setup, Pydantic v2 compatibility fixes (ObjectId serialization), added user models with , , OTP storage/expiration, password hashing (bcrypt), and email sending (simulated to console). Implemented signup, login, OTP verification, and Google OAuth endpoints.
-   ****: The entry point for the Expo Router application.
    -   **Importance**: Configures global providers (, , ).
    -   **Changes Made**: Restructured multiple times to correctly integrate  with  for context propagation and routing.
-   ****: Provides authentication state and functions to the app.
    -   **Importance**: Manages user session, login, logout, signup, OTP verification, and biometric authentication logic using  for token persistence.
    -   **Changes Made**: Updated to support email/password signup and login, OTP verification. Fixed  API calls.
-   ****: Centralized API client for all backend interactions.
    -   **Importance**: Handles HTTP requests, token attachment, and error handling. Ensures  prefix for all backend calls.
    -   **Changes Made**: Configured  instance to correctly append  to requests and added logging for debugging.
-   ****: Defines the main navigation structure using React Navigation.
    -   **Importance**: Orchestrates the flow between authentication screens and the main application (Home, Competitions, Wallet, Profile).
    -   **Changes Made**: Created to establish a clean, unified navigation stack, moving away from mixed  file-based auth routes.
-   ** (LoginScreen, SignupScreen, OTPVerificationScreen, EmailLoginScreen)**: Screens for user authentication flows.
    -   **Importance**: Provide UI for Google OAuth, email/password registration, OTP entry, and login.
    -   **Changes Made**: Created new screens, integrated with  and . Updated  to present both Google and email options and navigate using React Navigation.  was rewritten to fix syntax and integration issues.

<pending_tasks>
- Fix the OTP extraction logic in the frontend.
- Fully connect frontend signup/login flows to backend, ensuring redirection to the Home screen.
- Implement the dashboard (Home) screen.
- Implement competition management screens (create, join, list).
- Implement wallet management screens (personal, competition).
- Implement profile management screens (account, language, biometrics, logout).
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The immediate focus before this summary request was on debugging and fixing the persistent frontend navigation and API connectivity issues, specifically after a user reported the signup flow still wasn't working, causing an Unmatched Route error and a failure to redirect to the Home screen after successful authentication. The AI engineer identified issues with mixed  and  paradigms,  not propagating correctly to route-based screens, and  using incorrect navigation methods.

The AI engineer has:
- Restructured  and created  to establish a clean React Navigation stack.
- Removed the old file-based auth routes (e.g., ).
- Fixed the API service () to include console logging for debugging.
- Corrected navigation calls in  to use  instead of .
- Rewritten  to resolve a syntax error.
- Verified that the backend authentication (signup, OTP generation/verification, login) is fully functional using direct  commands.

However, the frontend still showed an Unmatched Route error upon attempting to navigate to the signup screen after login. The very last action was to identify a small issue with OTP extraction and plan its fix, followed by a FINAL COMPLETE TEST of the entire authentication and navigation flow to ensure users can reach the Dashboard and access all features.

<optional_next_step>
Fix the OTP extraction issue and then execute the FINAL COMPLETE TEST of the entire application.
