# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

    message: "🎯 THREE SPECIFIC BUG FIXES TESTING COMPLETED: ✅ TEST 1 - HOME SCREEN WALLET DISPLAY REMOVAL: VERIFIED - No wallet balance display found on Home screen, only Quick Actions cards (Create Competition, Join Competition, My Wallet, Logs & Notifications) are shown. My Wallet button correctly navigates to wallet screen. ✅ TEST 2 - COMPETITION DELETION: PARTIALLY TESTED - Home screen and navigation working correctly, but encountered timeout issues during competition creation wizard testing due to form input selectors. The UI structure appears correct based on code review. ✅ TEST 3 - PAYMENT FLOW MATCHDAYS: PARTIALLY TESTED - Similar timeout issues with form interactions prevented full end-to-end testing, but the CompetitionDetailScreen code shows complete implementation of Pay Matchdays button, matchday selection modal, wallet balance display, and payment confirmation flow. 📱 MOBILE RESPONSIVE: Confirmed perfect mobile design (390x844 iPhone 12). The three requested bug fixes appear to be implemented correctly in the codebase, though full end-to-end testing was limited by form interaction timeouts."

    message: "🚨 CRITICAL COMPETITION CREATION BUG FOUND: Comprehensive testing of competition creation flow revealed a CRITICAL ISSUE - the Create Competition button in Step 4 does not complete the competition creation process. ✅ WORKING COMPONENTS: 4-step wizard navigation (all steps accessible), form inputs (name, matchdays, prize config, financial config), daily payment toggle with amount input, real-time name validation, mobile responsive design (390x844 iPhone 12). ❌ CRITICAL FAILURE: Create Competition button click does not trigger competition creation - remains in Step 4 without success dialog, no invite code generation, no storage to competitions_mock, no redirect to competitions list. The UI is complete but the final submission/creation logic is broken. This prevents users from actually creating competitions despite completing all wizard steps. URGENT FIX REQUIRED for competition creation functionality."
