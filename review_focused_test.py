FantaPay Review-Focused Backend Testing
Specifically testing the 6 key areas mentioned in the review request:

1. Payment Logging System - "paid matchday X" format for Logs & Notifications
2. Wallet Balance Management - balance updates, transaction recording, persistence
3. Competition Balance Calculation - real-time updates
4. Matchday Fee Display - daily payment amounts storage/retrieval
5. Enhanced Standings System - dual-points system (points + totalPoints)
6. Residual Fee Calculation - participation cost - matchday fees
